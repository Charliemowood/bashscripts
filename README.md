This bash script is for creating all the initial files and boilerplate and installing dependencies

Clone this with `git clone git@github.com:eoghanscrowley/bashscripts.git`

then 
`cd bashscripts`
`chmod u+e kickoff`

Put `alias kickoff="~/path/to/kickoff"` in the .zshrc file

and it lets you use it anywhere by typing `kickoff <project-name>` from the terminal.
